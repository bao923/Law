<h4 class="underline">Arbitration and Mediation of Disputes.</h4>
<hr>
<p class="arbfile">Any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with this provision.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The parties shall select a single arbitrator from Ramos & Artal LLC (RA) or its successor, who shall be deemed acceptable to both parties,  within 14 calendar days after notice of a claim has been initiated.  Such arbitration shall be administered by RA or its successor in accordance with its own commercial arbitration rules (unless both parties consent to other procedures).  The dispute shall be heard and determined before a single arbitrator.  The arbitrator shall permit the filing of and make rulings upon a dispositive motion if the arbitrator determines that the motion is likely to succeed and dispose of or narrow the issues in the case. </p>
<p class="arbfile">The arbitration will be held in New York, New York, or such other place as may be agreed upon at the time by the parties to the arbitration. The parties shall bear their own expenses in connection with any arbitration arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  </p>
<p class="arbfile">The parties may also submit their controversy to private confidential non-binding mediation administered by RA or its successor.  Absent an agreement of the parties to the contrary, the mediation shall take place concurrently with the arbitration and shall not serve to delay arbitration proceedings.  </p>
<p class="arbfile">Note- if the parties wish to preserve their right to apply to the arbitrator for interim relief, the following should be added to the arbitration clause:</p>
<p class="arbfile">Either party may apply to the arbitrator to seek to enjoin preliminarily or permanently any breach or threatened breach of the other parties’ obligations.  The arbitrator may take whatever interim measures the arbitrator deems necessary including issuing an interim award, and granting temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief or any other form of equitable relief.  The arbitrator may also require security for the costs of such measures.   </p>
